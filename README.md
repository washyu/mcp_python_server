## 🏗️ Terraform vs SSH Commands

### **Why Terraform Integration Matters**
| Aspect | SSH Commands | Terraform | Benefit |
|--------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **State Tracking** | ❌ Manual | ✅ Automatic | Know exactly what was created |
| **Idempotency** | ❌ Can break | ✅ Safe reruns | Run deployments multiple times |
| **Clean Removal** | ❌ Orphaned resources | ✅ Complete cleanup | Remove only what Terraform created |
| **Drift Detection** | ❌ Manual checks | ✅ Automatic | Detect manual changes |
| **Rollback** | ❌ Manual process | ✅ State-based | Revert to previous configurations |

### **Deployment Methods Available**
```bash
# Docker Compose (fast, simple)
"Install Pi-hole using Docker Compose"

# Terraform (enterprise-grade, state-managed)  
"Install Pi-hole using Terraform with state management"

# Both methods support the same services with automatic accelerator detection
```

## 🎭 Ansible Configuration Management

### **Why Ansible for Multi-Service Deployments**
Perfect for deploying complete AI homelab stacks like MCP + Ollama + Web UI:

| Capability | Docker Compose | Terraform | Ansible | Best For |
|------------|----------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Single Host Services** | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good | ✅ Good | Simple deployments |
| **Multi-Host Orchestration** | ❌ Limited | ✅ Infrastructure | ✅ Configuration | Complex setups |
| **System Configuration** | ❌ Container only | ❌ Limited | ✅ Full control | OS-level setup |
| **Service Dependencies** | ✅ Basic | ✅ Resource deps | ✅ Cross-service config | Interconnected services |
| **Idempotent Operations** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Safe re-runs |

### **Available Ansible Services**
```bash
# Full AI homelab stack (MCP + Ollama + Web UI + Nginx)
"Install ai_homelab_stack_ansible on my Pi for complete AI setup"

# Individual service with system integration
"Install ollama_ansible on my server for system-level LLM hosting"
```

### **Ansible Tools**
- `check_ansible_service` - Verify Ansible deployment status
- `run_ansible_playbook` - Execute playbooks with tags/variables

### **Example: Complete AI Stack Deployment**
```bash
# One command deploys entire stack:
# ✅ MCP Server as systemd service
# ✅ Ollama with GPU/AI accelerator support  
# ✅ Web UI with pre-configured API endpoints
# ✅ Nginx reverse proxy with SSL ready
# ✅ Firewall configuration
# ✅ Health checks and monitoring

"Install ai_homelab_stack_ansible on my homelab server"
```

## Installation

### **Quick Start (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install uv (ultra-fast Python package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and run (takes 3 seconds!)
git clone https://github.com/washyu/mcp_python_server.git
cd mcp_python_server
uv sync && uv run python run_server.py
```

### **Traditional pip Installation**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/washyu/mcp_python_server.git
cd mcp_python_server

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (much slower than uv)
pip install -e .
```

### **For Development**
```bash
# Install with development dependencies
uv sync --group dev

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src/homelab_mcp
```

## Usage

### Running the Server

```bash
python run_server.py
```

The server communicates via stdio (stdin/stdout) using the MCP protocol.

### SSH Key Management

The MCP server automatically generates an SSH key pair on first initialization:
- Private key: `~/.ssh/mcp_admin_rsa`
- Public key: `~/.ssh/mcp_admin_rsa.pub`

This key is used for:
1. Authenticating as `mcp_admin` on remote systems after setup
2. Enabling passwordless SSH access for system management
3. Automatic authentication when using `ssh_discover` with username `mcp_admin`

### Testing with JSON-RPC

You can test the server by sending JSON-RPC requests:

```bash
# List available tools
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | python run_server.py

# Discover a system via SSH (with password)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"ssh_discover","arguments":{"hostname":"192.168.1.100","username":"user","password":"pass"}}}' | python run_server.py

# Discover using mcp_admin (no password needed after setup)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3b,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"ssh_discover","arguments":{"hostname":"192.168.1.100","username":"mcp_admin"}}}' | python run_server.py

# Setup mcp_admin on a remote system
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"setup_mcp_admin","arguments":{"hostname":"192.168.1.100","username":"admin","password":"adminpass"}}}' | python run_server.py

# Verify mcp_admin access
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"verify_mcp_admin","arguments":{"hostname":"192.168.1.100"}}}' | python run_server.py

# Use ssh_discover with mcp_admin (no password needed after setup)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":6,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"ssh_discover","arguments":{"hostname":"192.168.1.100","username":"mcp_admin"}}}' | python run_server.py
```

### Integration with AI Assistants

This server is designed to work with AI assistants that support the Model Context Protocol.

**🚀 For detailed Claude setup instructions, see [CLAUDE_SETUP.md](CLAUDE_SETUP.md)**

**Recommended configuration for Claude Desktop (using uv):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "homelab": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/uv",
      "args": ["run", "python", "/Users/your-username/workspace/mcp_python_server/run_server.py"],
      "cwd": "/Users/your-username/workspace/mcp_python_server"
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternative configuration (traditional Python):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "homelab": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/mcp_python_server/run_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/your/mcp_python_server/src"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Place this in:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Typical Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**: The MCP automatically generates its SSH key on first run
2. **Configure Remote System**: Use `setup_mcp_admin` with admin credentials to:
   - Create the `mcp_admin` user on the target system
   - Install the MCP's public key for authentication
   - Grant sudo privileges
3. **Verify Access**: Use `verify_mcp_admin` to confirm setup was successful
4. **Manage Systems**: Use `ssh_discover` with username `mcp_admin` for passwordless access

Example workflow:
```bash
# 1. Setup mcp_admin on a new system
{"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"setup_mcp_admin","arguments":{"hostname":"192.168.1.50","username":"pi","password":"raspberry"}}}

# 2. Verify the setup worked
{"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"verify_mcp_admin","arguments":{"hostname":"192.168.1.50"}}}

# 3. Now discover system info without needing passwords
{"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"ssh_discover","arguments":{"hostname":"192.168.1.50","username":"mcp_admin"}}}
```

### Handling Key Updates

If the `mcp_admin` user already exists but has a different SSH key, the `setup_mcp_admin` tool will automatically update it by default. You can control this behavior:

```bash
# Force update the SSH key (default behavior)
{"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"setup_mcp_admin","arguments":{"hostname":"192.168.1.50","username":"pi","password":"raspberry","force_update_key":true}}}

# Keep existing keys (only add if no MCP key exists)
{"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"setup_mcp_admin","arguments":{"hostname":"192.168.1.50","username":"pi","password":"raspberry","force_update_key":false}}}
```

When `force_update_key` is true (default), the tool will:
1. Remove any existing MCP keys (identified by the `mcp_admin@` comment)
2. Add the current MCP's public key
3. Preserve any other SSH keys the user might have

## 🎯 Example Use Cases
