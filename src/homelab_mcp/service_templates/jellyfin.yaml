# Monitoring suggestions
monitoring:
  key_metrics:
    - "Container health and uptime"
    - "CPU usage during transcoding"
    - "Disk I/O for media streaming"
    - "Network bandwidth usage"
  
  log_locations:
    - "/opt/jellyfin/config/log"
  
  common_issues:
    - "High CPU usage: Check transcoding settings and hardware acceleration"
    - "Slow loading: Check disk I/O and network connectivity"
    - "Playback issues: Verify codec support and transcoding configuration"

# Security considerations
security:
  recommendations:
    - "Use reverse proxy with SSL termination for external access"
    - "Enable two-factor authentication for admin accounts"
    - "Regularly update Jellyfin container image"
    - "Restrict network access if only used locally"
    - "Use read-only bind mounts for media directories"
  
  firewall_rules:
    - "Allow port 8096 from local network only"
    - "If using HTTPS, allow port 8920 from local network only"

# Troubleshooting
troubleshooting:
  common_problems:
    - problem: "Container won't start"
      solutions:
        - "Check port conflicts: sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :8096"
        - "Verify permissions: sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/jellyfin"
        - "Check logs: sudo docker logs jellyfin"
    
    - problem: "No hardware transcoding"
      solutions:
        - "Verify GPU drivers: lspci | grep VGA"
        - "Check device access: ls -la /dev/dri"
        - "Add user to video group: sudo usermod -aG video jellyfin"
    
    - problem: "Can't add media libraries"
      solutions:
        - "Check media directory exists: ls -la /opt/jellyfin/media"
        - "Verify permissions: sudo chmod 755 /opt/jellyfin/media"
        - "Ensure media files are accessible from container"
