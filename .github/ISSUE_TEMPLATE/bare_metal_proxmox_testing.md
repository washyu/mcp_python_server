## Problem
The MCP server has been developed and tested primarily in development environments. Before production deployment, it needs thorough testing with actual bare metal Proxmox infrastructure to validate:
- Real hardware discovery and GPU detection
- Network topology accuracy
- VM provisioning on physical hosts
- Resource allocation and optimization
- Performance at scale

## Requirements

### Test Environment Setup
- **Hardware**: Bare metal server(s) running Proxmox VE
- **Network**: Production-like network configuration with VLANs
- **Storage**: Multiple storage types (local, NAS, SAN)
- **Compute**: Multiple nodes with different capabilities
- **GPU**: Test GPU passthrough and AI workload placement

### Testing Scope

#### 1. Infrastructure Discovery
- [ ] Verify accurate hardware detection (CPU, memory, storage)
- [ ] Test GPU classification (AMD MI50, NVIDIA, Intel)
- [ ] Validate network topology discovery
- [ ] Check storage pool and datastore detection
- [ ] Test multi-node cluster discovery

#### 2. VM Provisioning
- [ ] Create VMs using Terraform integration
- [ ] Test intelligent node placement algorithms
- [ ] Verify cloud-init template functionality
- [ ] Validate resource allocation and limits
- [ ] Test VM lifecycle management (start/stop/delete)

#### 3. Service Deployment
- [ ] Deploy services using Ansible automation
- [ ] Test GPU passthrough for AI workloads
- [ ] Validate network-accessible service configuration
- [ ] Test service discovery and health monitoring

#### 4. Scale and Performance
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent VM operations
- [ ] Validate discovery performance with large inventories
- [ ] Test network scanning across multiple subnets
- [ ] Measure resource utilization during operations

#### 5. Error Handling
- [ ] Test behavior during network failures
- [ ] Validate error recovery for failed operations
- [ ] Test backup/restore scenarios
- [ ] Verify graceful degradation under load

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] **Security Audit**: Review authentication and authorization
- [ ] **Network Configuration**: Firewall rules, port access
- [ ] **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, storage quotas
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Logging, alerting, health checks
- [ ] **Documentation**: Updated for bare metal specifics
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Procedure for reverting changes

### Test Data Collection
- Performance metrics during operations
- Error logs and failure scenarios  
- Resource utilization patterns
- Network traffic analysis
- User experience feedback

## Acceptance Criteria
- All core MCP features work reliably on bare metal Proxmox
- Performance meets acceptable thresholds
- Error handling is robust and informative
- Security is validated in production-like environment
- Documentation is updated with bare metal considerations
- Rollback procedures are tested and documented

## Risks
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Some features may not work on specific hardware
- **Network Complexity**: Production networks may have unexpected configurations
- **Performance**: Real hardware may reveal performance bottlenecks
- **Data Loss**: Testing could affect existing infrastructure

## Mitigation
- Start with non-critical test hardware
- Implement comprehensive backup before testing
- Use staging environment that mirrors production
- Gradual rollout with monitoring at each step
