about: Implement backup and disaster recovery for MCP infrastructure state

## Problem
The MCP server now manages critical infrastructure state including:
- Terraform state files (VM provisioning) 
- Ansible execution history (configuration changes)
- Proxmox inventory and context
- Authentication configurations
- Homelab topology and device information

Currently, this state could be lost if the MCP server fails, causing loss of infrastructure management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Backup Scope
- **Infrastructure State**: Terraform state files, Ansible logs
- **Context Data**: Homelab topology, device inventory, discovery data  
- **Configuration**: Authentication configs, credentials (encrypted)
- **Templates**: Custom Terraform modules, Ansible playbooks
- **Execution History**: Audit trail of all infrastructure changes

### Backup Strategies to Evaluate
1. **Local Backup**
   - Automated ZIP exports of `/inventory` and `/terraform` directories
   - Scheduled snapshots with rotation policy
   - Git repository backup for configuration tracking

2. **Remote Backup** 
   - Integration with cloud storage (S3, Google Drive, Dropbox)
   - NAS/TrueNAS integration for homelab environments
   - Git repository with encrypted state files

3. **Real-time Sync**
   - Continuous sync to backup location
   - State replication across multiple MCP servers
   - Database backup for credential storage

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] Design backup data structure and manifest format
- [ ] Implement local backup with compression and encryption
- [ ] Add backup scheduling and rotation policies
- [ ] Create restore functionality with validation
- [ ] Add remote backup providers (S3, NAS, etc.)
- [ ] Test disaster recovery scenarios
- [ ] Document backup/restore procedures
- [ ] Add backup status monitoring and alerts

### Acceptance Criteria
- Complete infrastructure state can be backed up automatically
- Restore process recreates full MCP functionality
- Backup includes encryption for sensitive data
- Multiple backup destinations supported
- Configurable backup scheduling and retention
- Backup integrity verification
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities

## Impact
**High Priority** - Data loss could require complete infrastructure rediscovery and reconfiguration, causing significant downtime.
