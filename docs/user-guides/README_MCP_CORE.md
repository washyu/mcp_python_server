# Universal Homelab MCP Server

## üéØ **Primary Purpose: AI-Driven Infrastructure Automation**

This MCP server provides a comprehensive toolkit that enables **ANY AI agent** to automatically provision, configure, and manage complete homelab environments with minimal human intervention.

## üöÄ **Core Value Proposition**

**For AI Agents:** Complete infrastructure automation toolkit with smart defaults and comparative analysis
**For Users:** Get a fully functional homelab setup by simply describing your goals to any AI assistant

## üß† **How It Works**

1. **User:** "I want a homelab for media streaming and learning DevOps"
2. **AI Agent:** Uses MCP tools to automatically:
   - Assess available hardware capabilities
   - Choose optimal platform (Proxmox/LXD/Docker) 
   - Install and configure the platform
   - Deploy recommended services (Jellyfin, Pi-hole, Portainer)
   - Set up networking and security
   - Provide educational explanations of all decisions

3. **Result:** Complete, functional homelab with services running

## üõ† **MCP Tool Categories**

### **Priority 1: Agent Automation Tools** (Main Feature)
```
auto-setup-homelab          # Complete automated setup
compare-storage-solutions    # TrueNAS vs Windows SMB vs Nextcloud analysis
recommend-service-stack      # Service recommendations based on goals
deploy-service-stack         # Automated service deployment
explain-technology-choice    # Educational explanations of decisions
troubleshoot-issue          # Automated problem diagnosis and fixes
```

### **Priority 2: Infrastructure Discovery**
```
list_nodes                  # Discover Proxmox cluster resources
list_vms                   # Smart VM filtering and discovery
discover_hardware          # GPU, CPU, storage detection
suggest_deployment         # AI-powered workload placement
```

### **Priority 3: Container Platform**
```
install-lxd               # Auto-install LXD if missing
create-lxd-container      # Create containers with smart placement
install-service-lxd       # Deploy services in containers
```

### **Priority 4: User Guidance** (When Agent Needs Input)
```
setup-ollama             # Local AI assistant setup
compare-technologies     # Technology comparison on demand
explain-concept         # Educational explanations
```

## üîß **Example AI Agent Workflow**

```python
# AI Agent receives: "Set up a homelab on my Raspberry Pi for media and learning"

# 1. Automated assessment
result = await auto_setup_homelab(
    target_host="proxmoxpi.local",
    user_goals=["media", "learning"],
    hardware_type="raspberry-pi"
)

# 2. Agent explains choices made
explanation = await explain_technology_choice(
    chosen_tech="lxd",
    alternatives=["docker", "proxmox"],
    context="raspberry-pi with 4GB RAM"
)

# 3. User gets complete setup + education about decisions
```

## üéì **Educational Philosophy**

Every automated decision includes explanations:
- **Why** this technology was chosen
- **Industry relevance** of the skills learned
- **Trade-offs** and alternatives considered
- **Next steps** for expanding knowledge

## üåê **Universal Compatibility**

Works with any AI assistant that supports MCP:
- Claude (Anthropic)
- Local Ollama models
- OpenAI GPT models
- Custom AI applications

## üìä **Technology Comparison Database**

Built-in knowledge for agent decision-making:
- **Storage:** TrueNAS vs Windows SMB vs Nextcloud vs Simple Samba
- **Virtualization:** Proxmox vs LXD vs Docker
- **Hardware Requirements:** Memory, CPU, storage for each option
- **Industry Relevance:** How skills transfer to enterprise roles

## üéØ **Target Users**

- **Homelab beginners** who want automated setup with learning
- **Developers** who need quick dev environments  
- **IT professionals** practicing enterprise technologies
- **AI enthusiasts** wanting local, private AI assistance

## üîß **Quick Start for AI Agents**

```bash
# Start the MCP server
python -m src.server.mcp_server

# AI Agent can now use tools like:
auto-setup-homelab target_host=192.168.1.100 user_goals=["media","learning"]
```

## üìà **Value for Users**

- **Zero Learning Curve:** AI handles all technical decisions
- **Industry Skills:** Learn enterprise-grade technologies  
- **Cost Effective:** Open source alternatives to paid services
- **Privacy Focused:** Local AI, self-hosted services
- **Educational:** Understand every decision made
