# AI Training from MCP Infrastructure Data

## ðŸŽ¯ **The Opportunity**

We've built a comprehensive MCP server with:
- **Real infrastructure data** (Proxmox VMs, storage, networks)
- **Natural language query patterns** (100+ test cases)
- **Intent parsing logic** (filters, edge cases, validation)
- **Error handling examples** (malformed queries, nonsensical requests)

This creates a **perfect training dataset** for IT-focused AI models.

## ðŸ“Š **Training Data We've Generated**

### **1. Query Understanding Patterns**
```
Input: "running ubuntu vms with 8gb memory"
Intent: {"status": "running", "os": "ubuntu", "min_memory": 8192}
Action: Filter VMs by status AND OS AND memory
Result: [ollama-server, production-database-server]
```

### **2. Infrastructure Context Awareness**
```
Context: Proxmox homelab with 8 VMs, 3 storage pools, 1 template
Query: "vm 203"
Knowledge: VM 203 = ollama-server (16GB, 8 cores, running)
Response: Specific, contextual information
```

### **3. Edge Case Handling**
```
Input: "microsoft bob instances"
Recognition: Nonsensical query (obsolete system)
Response: Educational tip + realistic alternatives
Learning: Don't show irrelevant data for impossible queries
```

### **4. Technical Validation**
```
Input: "vms with 999gb memory"
Validation: Exceeds reasonable homelab limits
Correction: Cap at 64GB maximum
Learning: Apply domain-specific constraints
```

## ðŸ§  **Training Methodologies**

### **Method 1: Instruction Following Fine-Tuning**

Create training pairs like:
```json
{
  "instruction": "You are an IT infrastructure assistant. Parse this query and return appropriate filters.",
  "input": "Show me running ubuntu servers with at least 8GB memory",
  "output": {
    "filters": {"status": "running", "os": "ubuntu", "min_memory": 8192},
    "reasoning": "User wants active Ubuntu VMs with sufficient memory for applications"
  }
}
```

### **Method 2: Contextual Infrastructure Training**

```json
{
  "system": "You manage a Proxmox homelab with these resources: [inventory_context]",
  "user": "Which server should I use for a memory-intensive application?",
  "assistant": "Based on current resources, ollama-server (VM 203) has 16GB RAM and is currently running with 12GB used. Production-database-server (VM 999) has 32GB RAM with minimal usage. I recommend the production server for your memory-intensive workload."
}
```

### **Method 3: Error Recovery Training**

```json
{
  "input": "List all skynet servers",
  "context": "No results found for unusual system type",
  "output": "I don't see any Skynet systems in your homelab! ðŸ˜Š Try these instead:\nâ€¢ 'ubuntu servers' - Shows Ubuntu VMs\nâ€¢ 'running vms' - Shows active systems\nâ€¢ 'mysql servers' - Shows database servers"
}
```

## ðŸŽ“ **Specialized IT Skills Training**

### **Infrastructure Reasoning**
Train the AI to understand:
- **Resource allocation**: "This VM needs 8GB for MySQL + 4GB for OS = 12GB minimum"
- **Capacity planning**: "You have 66GB total, 18GB used, so 48GB available"
- **Performance analysis**: "High CPU usage on VM 203 suggests need for scaling"

### **Operational Knowledge**
- **Best practices**: "Template 9000 is your standard Ubuntu base"
- **Troubleshooting**: "VM stopped status often means resource constraints"
- **Security awareness**: "Production VMs should be isolated from test systems"

### **Domain-Specific Vocabulary**
- **Technical terms**: VMID, maxmem, storage pools, bridge networks
- **Service context**: MySQL databases, web servers, development environments
- **Infrastructure patterns**: Production vs development, scaling considerations

## ðŸ”¬ **Implementation Approaches**

### **Approach A: Dataset Creation Pipeline**

```python
def create_training_data():
    """Generate comprehensive IT training dataset."""
    
    # 1. Extract all test cases
    test_cases = collect_all_test_cases()
    
    # 2. Add real infrastructure context
    infrastructure = load_proxmox_inventory()
    
    # 3. Generate instruction-following pairs
    training_pairs = []
    for test in test_cases:
        training_pairs.append({
            "instruction": "Parse this infrastructure query and return structured filters",
            "input": test.query,
            "output": test.expected_filters,
            "context": infrastructure
        })
    
    # 4. Add reasoning chains
    for pair in training_pairs:
        pair["reasoning"] = generate_reasoning_chain(pair)
    
    return training_pairs
```

### **Approach B: Synthetic Data Generation**

```python
def generate_synthetic_it_scenarios():
    """Create varied IT scenarios for robust training."""
    
    scenarios = [
        # Resource management
        ("I need to allocate more memory to VM 203", "resource_allocation"),
        ("Which VMs are using the most CPU?", "performance_analysis"),
        ("Can I safely shut down the mysql server?", "dependency_analysis"),
        
        # Troubleshooting
        ("VM 998 won't start", "troubleshooting"),
        ("Storage pool is getting full", "capacity_management"),
        ("Network connectivity issues", "network_diagnosis"),
        
        # Planning
        ("Where should I deploy a new web server?", "placement_planning"),
        ("How much memory do I have available?", "capacity_planning"),
        ("Which template should I use for Ubuntu?", "best_practices")
    ]
    
    return expand_scenarios_with_context(scenarios)
```

### **Approach C: Real-World Integration Training**

```python
def create_workflow_training():
    """Train on complete IT workflows."""
    
    workflows = [
        {
            "scenario": "Deploy new MySQL database",
            "steps": [
                "Check available resources",
                "Select appropriate node",
                "Clone from template 9000", 
                "Allocate 8GB RAM, 4 cores",
                "Configure networking",
                "Install MySQL",
                "Secure configuration",
                "Create backup schedule"
            ],
            "context": "Production deployment requiring high availability"
        }
    ]
    
    return workflows
```
