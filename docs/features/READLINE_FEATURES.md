# Readline Features Implementation

## ✨ New Chat Interface Features

I've enhanced the homelab chat interface with full **readline support** for a much better user experience:

### 🔍 Command History
- **↑/↓ arrows** - Browse through previous commands
- **Ctrl+R** - Reverse search through history  
- **Persistent history** - Commands saved between sessions in `~/.homelab_chat_history`
- **1000 command limit** - Automatic cleanup of old history

### ✏️ Line Editing
- **←/→ arrows** - Move cursor left/right to edit current line
- **Ctrl+A** - Jump to beginning of line
- **Ctrl+E** - Jump to end of line  
- **Ctrl+K** - Delete from cursor to end of line
- **Ctrl+U** - Delete entire line
- **Ctrl+W** - Delete word before cursor

### 🎯 Tab Completion
- **Tab** - Auto-complete commands and common phrases
- **Tab Tab** - Show all possible completions

**Completions include:**
- Chat commands: `help`, `status`, `quit`, `debug`, etc.
- Server commands: `use `, `set server `, `discover`
- Common phrases: `My homelab consists of`, `I have a pi called`, etc.
- Context-aware: Includes current server name in completions

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **`_setup_readline()`** - Configures readline with history file and key bindings
2. **`get_user_input()`** - Replacement for Rich's Prompt.ask() with readline support
3. **`_tab_completer()`** - Custom tab completion for homelab-specific commands

### Key Features
- **History persistence** - Commands saved in `~/.homelab_chat_history`
- **Error handling** - Graceful fallback if readline unavailable
- **Cross-platform** - Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (with some limitations)
- **Integration** - Seamlessly works with existing Rich console output

### Files Modified
- **`start_homelab_chat.py`** - Added readline imports and configuration
- **Interactive chat loop** - Replaced Rich input with readline-enabled input
- **Help system** - Updated to document new features

## 🧪 Testing

**Test the features:**
```bash
python test_readline_features.py  # Test readline configuration
python main.py --mode chat         # Use the enhanced chat interface
```

**Try these features:**
1. Type a command, then use ↑ arrow to recall it
2. Type `he` and press Tab to complete to `help`
3. Type `My ho` and press Tab to complete to `My homelab consists of`
4. Use ← → arrows to move cursor and edit text inline
5. Use Ctrl+A to jump to start, Ctrl+E to end of line

## 🎉 Benefits

### Before (Rich Prompt.ask):
- ❌ No command history
- ❌ No cursor movement within line
- ❌ No tab completion
- ❌ Had to retype similar commands

### After (Readline):
- ✅ Full command history with ↑/↓
- ✅ Cursor movement with ←/→ 
- ✅ Tab completion for commands
- ✅ Standard terminal editing shortcuts
- ✅ History persists between sessions

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **History Navigation**: Use ↑ to find previous similar commands
2. **Quick Editing**: Use ← → to fix typos without retyping entire command
3. **Tab Completion**: Start typing and hit Tab for suggestions
4. **Line Shortcuts**: Ctrl+U to clear line, Ctrl+A/E to jump to ends
5. **Search History**: Ctrl+R to search for commands containing specific text

The chat interface now feels like a professional terminal application with full editing capabilities!

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- **Smart completion** - Complete hostnames from homelab context
- **Command aliases** - Short forms for common operations  
- **Multi-line input** - Support for complex queries
- **Syntax highlighting** - Color-coded input for commands vs queries
